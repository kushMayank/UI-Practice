What is React Fiber architecture?


    -> The Fiber Tree is React’s internal data structure where each component is represented as a fiber node. 
    It allows React to manage rendering efficiently by enabling incremental updates, prioritization, and interruptible rendering through the React Fiber architecture.

🧠 Why React created Fiber? 

    Before Fiber (old “stack” reconciler), React:
        Rendered everything synchronously
        Could block UI if work was heavy
        Could not pause or prioritize updates

    React Fiber solves this by making rendering:
        Interruptible
        Prioritized
        Incremental
        More efficient

        So React can pause rendering, update something urgent (like typing), then resume.

⚙️ How Fiber helps performance

    Fiber allows React to:

    1. Pause rendering
        If rendering is heavy:
        React can stop midway
        Let browser handle user input
        Resume later

    2. Prioritize updates

        Example:
        Typing in input → high priority
        Background data fetch → low priority
        React schedules work accordingly.

    3. Avoid blocking UI

        Old React: one big synchronous render
        Fiber: small chunks of work

🎯 Render vs Commit phase (interview gold)
    🧠 Render Phase

    Builds new fiber tree

    Calls components

    Calculates changes

    Can pause/resume

    No DOM changes

    ⚡ Commit Phase

    Applies changes to DOM

    Runs useEffect

    Updates refs

    Cannot pause

    Very fast      

🔥 One-line memory trick
    Render phase prepares updates (can pause)
    Commit phase applies updates (cannot pause)
