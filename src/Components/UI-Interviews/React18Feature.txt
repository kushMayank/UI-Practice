WORDING -> I’m using React 18. It introduced major features like concurrent rendering, automatic batching, the new createRoot API, Suspense improvements, 
and hooks like useTransition and useDeferredValue which help improve performance and user experience by making rendering more efficient and non-blocking.

🚀 Major features introduced in React 18
    1️⃣ Concurrent Rendering (Biggest feature)

        React 18 introduced concurrent rendering.
        It allows React to:
            Pause rendering
            Resume rendering
            Prioritize urgent updates
            Keep UI responsive

        Example:
            Typing input → high priority
            Big list rendering → low priority
            React handles both smoothly.

        👉 Makes apps faster and smoother.

    2️⃣ Automatic Batching

        Before React 18:
            Batching only worked inside React event handlers.

        Now in React 18:
            Batching works everywhere:

        setTimeout
        API calls
        promises
        async/await

        Example:
            setCount(c => c + 1);
            setAge(a => a + 1);
        Now React does:
            Only ONE re-render instead of multiple.

        Improves performance.

    3️⃣ createRoot API (New root API)

        Old React (17):
        ReactDOM.render(<App />, root);


        React 18:
        import { createRoot } from "react-dom/client";
        const root = createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));
        root.render(<App />);
        This enables concurrent features.

    4️⃣ useTransition Hook

        Used for:
            Non-urgent UI updates
        Example:
            Searching
            Filtering large list
            Navigation

            const [isPending, startTransition] = useTransition();

                startTransition(() => {
                setList(newList);
                });


        Makes UI smooth without lag.

    5️⃣ useDeferredValue
        Used to delay heavy updates.

        Example:

            Search input

            Large filtering

            const deferredValue = useDeferredValue(search);


        Improves performance.

    6️⃣ Suspense improvements

        React 18 improved Suspense:
        Works better with data fetching
        Better loading UI handling
        Concurrent rendering support
