2️⃣ useReducer (Advanced state management)

    Used for:
        Complex state logic or multiple related states
        Similar to Redux reducer.

    Example
        const initialState = {count:0};

        function reducer(state, action){
        switch(action.type){
            case "increment":
            return {count: state.count + 1};
            default:
            return state;
        }
        }

        const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState);

    🎯 Interview questions on useReducer
        Q1: When to use useReducer instead of useState?

            Answer:
            When state logic is complex, involves multiple sub-values, or depends on previous state.

            Example:
            Shopping cart
            Form with many fields
            Complex updates

        Q2: Difference between useState and useReducer?
            useState	useReducer
            Simple state	Complex state
            Easy syntax	Reducer pattern
            Local updates	Centralized logic
            Small apps	Large apps
            Q3: Is useReducer like Redux?

        Yes, it follows reducer pattern (state + action → new state).

3️⃣ useContext (Global state management)

    Used to share state across components without prop drilling.

    Example:
        User auth
        Theme
        Language
        Global settings

    Example

        const ThemeContext = createContext();

        function App(){
        const [theme,setTheme] = useState("dark");

        return (
            <ThemeContext.Provider value={{theme,setTheme}}>
            <Child/>
            </ThemeContext.Provider>
        );
        }
