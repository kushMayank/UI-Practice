🚨 What exactly blocks UI?

    When React doing:
        Big rendering
        Big calculation
        DOM updates
        
    Browser cannot:
        Handle typing
        Scroll smoothly
        Click fast
        UI freezes.

    This is called:
    Blocking main thread

🧠 Then how React 18 solves?

    Using concurrent rendering.

    React says:
        Typing = urgent
        Big rendering = not urgent

    So React:
        Lets typing happen first
        Pauses heavy rendering
        Continues later
        UI smooth.    


🎯 Method 1: useTransition (YOU control update)

    👉 You tell React:
        “This state update is heavy — run it later”
        You manually mark update as low priority.

    Example
        const [isPending, startTransition] = useTransition();

        const handleChange = (e) => {
        setSearch(e.target.value); // urgent

        startTransition(() => {
            setFilteredList(filterData(e.target.value)); // heavy
        });
        };

    Meaning

    You are telling React:
        Input update urgent
        Filtering update low priority

    You control it manually.        


🎯 Method 2: useDeferredValue (React controls delay)

    Here you don’t control update.
    You just say:
    “React, delay this value”

    Example
        const [search, setSearch] = useState("");
        const deferredSearch = useDeferredValue(search);

        const filtered = bigData.filter(item =>
        item.includes(deferredSearch)
        );

    Meaning
    You tell React:
    Use delayed search value for filtering
    React automatically delays heavy work.
    You don't manually control anything.

🧠 Real-life analogy

    Imagine food delivery 🍕

    useTransition

        You call restaurant and say:
        Deliver pizza later, I’m busy
        You control timing.

    useDeferredValue

        Swiggy automatically delays delivery because traffic.
        System controls timing.
