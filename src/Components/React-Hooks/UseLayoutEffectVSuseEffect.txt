🚀 What is useEffect?

   useEffect runs after rendering + after browser paint

   Meaning:

   React renders UI
   Browser shows UI on screen
   Then useEffect runs

   Example
   useEffect(() => {
   console.log("useEffect runs");
   }, []);


   Used for:
   API calls
   setTimeout
   event listeners
   console logs
   side effects

   Because it doesn't block UI.

🚀 What is useLayoutEffect?

   useLayoutEffect runs:

      After render but BEFORE browser paints screen

      Meaning:
      React renders UI
      useLayoutEffect runs
      Then browser paints screen
      So it blocks screen painting until finished.

      Example
      useLayoutEffect(() => {
      console.log("useLayoutEffect runs");
      }, []);
